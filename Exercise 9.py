# Write a Car class that has the following properties: registration number, maximum speed, current speed and travelled distance.
# Add a class initializer that sets the first two of the properties based on parameter values.
# The current speed and travelled distance of a new car must be automatically set to zero.
# Write a main program where you create a new car (registration number ABC-123, maximum speed 142 km/h).
# Finally, print out all the properties of the new car.
